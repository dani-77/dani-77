## Hi there !

My name is Daniel and I am an open source enthusiast. 

I am working on d77Void, a Void respin with several WM, the DE Cosmic, LXQt and XFCE4. 

Currently I am the maintainer of my own repository d77void-pkgs, where you can found, among others, Brave browser, Yubikey authenticator, 
wmd77 (my Rust Penrose lib WM), patched versions of suckless tools like dwm, slstatus, st, surf and many more.

In the paste few years I worked on:

d77coreboot - corebooting laptops

d77crux - porting packages to CRUX

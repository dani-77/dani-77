# Hi there!

My name is Daniel and I am an open source enthusiast. 

I am working on [d77Void](https://github.com/dani-77/d77void), a Void respin with several WM, the DE Cosmic, LXQt and XFCE4. 

Currently I am the maintainer of my own repository [d77void-pkgs](https://github.com/dani-77/d77void-pkgs), where you can find, among others, Brave browser, Yubikey authenticator, 
wmd77 (my Rust Penrose lib WM), patched versions of suckless tools like dwm, slstatus, st, surf and many more.

## Past

In the past few years I worked on:

[d77coreboot](https://github.com/dani-77/d77coreboot) - corebooting laptops

[d77crux](https://github.com/dani-77/d77crux) - porting packages to CRUX 

## Future

I am developing/learning to program in Python, C, Haskell and Rust; I hope to improve my skills by being more pragmatic in choosing what to do and what to read/observe, and by being more disciplined.
